# Part 1: Introduction and Research Questions
Traffic accidents are a significant public safety concern, leading to injuries, fatalities, and economic losses. Understanding the factors that contribute to the occurrence of traffic accidents is crucial for developing effective preventive measures. This research aims to investigate the relationship between demographic factors and the frequency of traffic accidents in North Carolina. Our research questions are as follows:

Do demographic factors such as age, car type, and gender significantly contribute to the occurrence of traffic accidents in North Carolina?
Can a predictive model be developed, incorporating age, car type, and gender, to assess the likelihood of a traffic accident in North Carolina?

We believe that these research questions are substantial because the inclusion of age, car type, and gender as demographic factors covers a broad spectrum of variables that may influence driving behavior and accident rates. This study's findings can contribute to evidence-based policymaking and targeted safety campaigns.
